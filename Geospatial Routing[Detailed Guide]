Network Analysis on Geospatial Data (shapefile)

Network analysis on Geospatial data in shapefile(.shp) format.

--->>>>>>>>Setting Up Geospatial Database

The Database is created using the PostgreSQL
Extending our Database for Geospatial Capabilities
The PostGIS extension provides spatial objects for the PostgreSQL database and extends database for geospatial capabilities.

Add Pgrouting Extension

The pgrouting Extension extends the PostGIS geospatial database to provide geospatial routing functionality.

 --->>>>>>>>Setting up QGIS’s Plug-In (DB Manager)

QGIS provide a ‘DB Manager’ plug-in which manage the database within QGIS.

--->>>>>>>>>Establishing a Connection
A connection needs to be established between QGIS and PostgreSQL. It is to be noted the connection needs to be established only for first time after that DB Manager makes a registry for that connection. Thus we only need to provide the credentials for logging into the Geospatial database next time.

(For First Time Only):
Click LAYERS in QGIS working space and select ADD POSTGIS LAYERS.
Create a new connection here Road Network is created as a new connection.
Click [connect] which will bring all the schemas from the database at the backend.

Now fire up the DB Manager plug-In which will automatically include the new connection in its registry.
Establishing Connection
Steps:
•	Open DB Manager
•	Select PostGIS>postgres on left hand side
•	Enter the Credentials to establish a connection 
The connection between QGIS and PostgreSQL must be established before importing a shapefile. Import layer/file option is used to import shapefile into QGIS.
The Imported Shapefile in DB Manager Plug-In
Display The Imported Shapefile on QGIS Canvas

 
 --->>>>>>>>>Applying PgRouting Functions

(Optional Steps)

Note: The shapefile is not noded for routing purposes thus pgr_nodenetwork needs to be implemented to make the shapefile noded. 
Geometry which is in MultiLIneString needs to be converted into linestring for pgr_nodenetwork function to be implemented.
If the shapefile is made for routing proposes we can directly create topology without using the pgr_nodenetwork. 

Converting Multilinestring Geometry to LineString Geometry
The PostGIS function ST_Dump(geom) is used to convert the multilinestring to linearstring. Here the Parameter geom is in multlinestring.
A new table have to be created in which the Geometry is in linestring.

Creating a new table using PostgreSQL
Creating a new table named ind_roads_linestring with id and geom as its columns
Now Using SQL Query we will populate the id and geometry column in the new table ind_road_linestring.

SQL Query

INSERT INTO network.ind_roads_linestring(id, geom)
SELECT id, (ST_Dump(geom)) .geom
FROM network.ind_road;
Updated table in DdManager (Linestring Geometry) 

 
--->>>>>>>Applying pgr_nodeNetwork 

A common problem associated with bringing GIS data into PgRouting is the fact that the data is often not “noded” correctly.
This will create invalid topologies, which will result in routes that are incorrect.
This function reads the ind_roads_linestring table, that has a primary key column id and geometry column named geom and 
intersect all the segments in it against all the other segments and then creates a table Ind_roads-linestring_noded.
It uses the tolerance for deciding that multiple nodes within the tolerance are considered the same node.
This function automatically creates the Source and Target Colums.


NOTE: For already noded shapefile manually create the Source and Target Columns using 

SQL Query (Here roads shapefile is already noded)

Alter table network.roads add column source integer
Alter table network.roads add column target integer

 

--->>>>>>>>Applying pgr_Createtopology Function

	Builds a network topology based on the geometry information. 
	This function populates the Source and Target of each road segment in the database in appropriate column.
	Basically it create vertices on road network which can be used for routing purposes


Results of pgr_createTopology() function is reflected in database at backend.

--->>>>>>>>>Applying pgr_dijkstra for Calculating Shortest path

SQL Query for determining the shortest path between two nodes in the road network.
   
(Dijkstra's algorithm) 

SQL QUERY
SELECT seq, id1 AS node, id2 AS edge, cost,geom
  FROM pgr_dijkstra(
    'SELECT   id::int4, source::int4  , target::int4 , st_length(geom) AS cost FROM network.ind_roads_linestring_noded',
   206, 8068, false, false
  )as di
  JOIN network.ind_roads_linestring_noded pt
  ON di.id2 = pt.id

 NOTE
	Here we are using JOIN to join the original network.ind_roads_linestring_noded table to the results of pgr_dijkstra result
  so that results can be visualized on the canvas.
	We need to type cast our parameters as the data type created automatically by the node network function doesn’t match with
  the pgr_dijkstra query

The Node Id’s are selected from the QGIS canvas using Identify Features. 
Results of SQL query is returned & finally is loaded into new layer called ‘query’. 
 
--->>>>>>>>>Applying pgr_bidijkstra for Calculating Shortest path

Bi-directional Dijkstra
This is a bi-directional Dijkstra search algorithm. It searches from the source toward the destination and at the same time from the destination to the source and terminates where these two searches meet in the middle. 

NOTE
	Here we are using JOIN to join the original network.ind_roads_linestring_noded table to the results of pgr_dijkstra
  result so that results can be visualized on the canvas.
	We need to type cast our parameters as the data type created automatically by the node network function doesn’t match
  with the pgr_dijkstra query.
